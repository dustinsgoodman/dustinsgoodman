# Hi there 👋, I'm Dustin

I'm a Software Engineering Manager and Developer specializing in web technologies. I also speak and write on my work experiences in the software industry. You can find my content at [dustingoodman.dev](https://dustingoodman.dev).

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

## 🧑‍💼 What I'm Doing

Currently, I'm working as an Engineering Manager at [This Dot Labs](https://github.com/thisdot) with the amazing [Tracy Lee](https://github.com/ladyleet) and a bunch of other amazing folks where we're working to help grow the worldwide developer community around a common goal of learning about and furthering web technologies.

## 💬 Ask me about

I love all things technology and am happy to talk about just about anything programming related. I have a formal degree in Computer Science and love to nerd out on data structure and algorithm topics that you find in real-world systems. I also love to talk about the following lanaguages:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Ruby
- Python

I also love talking about these technology frameworks:

- React.js
- GraphQL
- Serverless Framework
- Node.js Backends
- Angular
- Ruby on Rails

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

I just finished building my personal site using [Astro](https://astro.build/). Next, I plan on making improvements to my [Serverless Template](https://github.com/dustinsgoodman/serverless-template) to help teams build Serverless applications using microservice architectures in a monorepo setup.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

I'm looking forward to trying out [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Qwik](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik).
